# Call-Centre-Analysis-and-Dashboard
Analysis of the Call Centre Dataset and Tableau Dashboard creation

The dataset contains historical data from a call Centre, including information about calls, agents, and customer feedback. The goal is to identify patterns, trends, and areas for improvement in Call Centre operations.

Project Deliverables:-
1. Call Volume Analysis Dashboard
2. AHT Analysis Dashboard
3. CSAT Score Dashboard
4. Agent Level Analysis Dashboard

Analyzing the Call Centre Data, we have created the above 4 dashboards. From them, we can conclude the performance of the Agents as well as who requires more training and who are the top performers for the Call Centre. Also, we can conclude which zone is proving much more profitable and which is an outlier and requires attention.
